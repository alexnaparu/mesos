  # TODO(hausdorff): (MESOS-3394) Upgrade Windows to use glog v0.3.5, as that
  # release will contain fixes that will allow us to build glog on Windows.
  #
  # NOTE: hausdorff has ported glog v0.3.4 to support compilation with MSVC
  # 1900 (it works on MSVC 1800, but not 1900). The patch has been submitted
  # to the glog project which you can see in pull request #43[1].
  #
  # Note also that this tarball actually points directly at the branch the
  # PR is issued from, and uses the GitHub REST API to get a tarball of it.
  # We think this is stictly better than pulling a tarball out of 3rdparty, or
  # running `patch` on a tarball version of the vanilla 0.3.4 release, because
  # it means that this code will automatically be up-to-date, and to transition
  # to the next release of glog (when this will presumably be fixed), we need
  # only change this line.
  #
  # Finally, for our third-party libraries, MSVC 1800 and 1900 are not
  # linker-compatible, so it's important for us to be able to build glog
  # (as well as all the other third-party dependencies) on MSVC 1900.

# Define build/patch/configure commands for third-party libs.
#############################################################
# FIX(MESOS-3250): A few third-party libraries (libev, gmock) do not have
# `make install` commands available, so below we have to add our own "install"
# commands.
#
# The reason is: if we do not, we get runtime library load problems on OS X. In
# particular, `dydl` will look for these libraries at the prefix we passed to
# `configure` (or in `/usr/local` if we did not pass a prefix in), but since
# they don't have a `make install` step, they never get placed in the prefix
# folder.
#
# Our solution is to:
#   (1) make a lib directory inside the Mesos folder for each of the libraries
#       that has no install step, and
#   (2) copy all such libraries into their respective directories.
#
# (Note that step (1) is not only convenient, but important: make will add a
# `lib` to the end of your prefix path when linking, and since the built
# libraries end up in a `.libs` folder, it's not enough to simply pass the
# build directory into `configure` as a prefix; so if we're going to move the
# libraries, we might as well move them to a library folder.)

# Third-party libraries. Tell the build system how to pull in and build third-
# party libraries at compile time, using the ExternalProject_Add macro.
##############################################################################
# NOTE: On ExternalProject_Add calls in the next section, we pass some
# quoted values into `ExternalProject_Add`. We do this because some of these
# projects can't (or shouldn't) be built from the command line (for various
# reasons), and we need to get creative about what values we pass in to make
# sure these operations are no-ops.
#
# There are two flavors of work-around here. The first we use to avoid building
# third-party projects (like Boost) that never need to be built for Mesos. This
# looks like this:
#
#     BUILD_COMMAND ""
#
# In most of the major releases of CMake, if we don't set parameters like
# `BUILD_COMMAND`, we will trigger the default behavior of that parameter;
# usually, CMake attempts to configure/build/install/etc. the third-party
# project as if it were a CMake (or perhaps make) project. Since these projects
# are not CMake projects, they will error out. This work-around lets us avoid
# that fate altogether.
#
# The second work-around allows us to build a project except on Windows. It
# looks like this:
#
#     BUILD_COMMAND "${GLOG_BUILD_CMD}"
#
# The problem is that there is currently no way to build glog on Windows from
# the command line. But, if GLOG_BUILD_CMD is not set (or if it's an empty
# list), then we run into the same problem as last time; CMake sees that
# `BUILD_COMMAND` is unset, and will default to the "normal" behavior of trying
# to configure/build/install the project as if it was a CMake project. (Since
# it is not, it will of course error out on Windows.)
#
# The work-around is to add quotes to the outside of the variable. In this case,
# ${GLOG_BUILD_CMD} will expand to unset, which will cause us to pass the empty
# string as a parameter to the function. This of course is different from not
# setting the parameter value at all, and hence the work-around works.
